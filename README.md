# Swarm Intelligence and Evolutionary Algorithms

This repository is developed as part of the Swarm Intelligence and Evolutionary Algorithms course in the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence program at FH Joanneum Graz.

It contains various tasks and experiments implementing swarm intelligence and evolutionary algorithms, which are documented and interactively demonstrated using Streamlit. The goal is to make the functionality and behavior of these algorithms understandable and visually accessible.
